# My Edited Version of “Web Notifications”

## Web Notifications
Notifications are a great way to know if you have new followers, replies, or messages. For new activity on your blog, a notification badge appears above the lightning “activity” icon in the menu of your dashboard. You can click the icon to open your [blog activity](https://www.tumblr.com/blog/invisiblevalet/activity) tab to view the latest notifications. 

If you have more than one blog, you can view each blog’s activity independently. To view recent activity for a blog: 
1. Click “Account” in the sidebar menu. 
2. In the Blogs section, click the blog. 
3. Click “See everything” on the pop-up.

# [Original Tumblr "Web Notification"](https://help.tumblr.com/web-notifications/)

## Web Notifications

Notifications are a great way for you to find out if you have new followers, post replies, or new messages. For any new activity on your blog you’ll see a notification badge above the activity icon (lightning) in the top bar of your dashboard. Clicking on the activity icon will open your [blog activity](https://www.tumblr.com/blog/invisiblevalet/activity) displaying the latest activity on your blog.
You can select which blog’s activity to view by clicking on the blog name and selecting a different blog from the drop-down menu. Clicking “See everything” at the bottom of this pop-up will take you to your blog’s full activity dashboard.

### Post-Level Notifications

One of your posts broke containment and now your notifications and activity are being flooded! What can you do? You can mute notifications and activity (likes, reblogs, replies, etc.) about any of your posts, either temporarily or permanently.

To mute notifications on a specific post:
1. Navigate to the post on your blog in bluespace (e.g. https://tumblr.com/blog/username or https://tumblr.com/username)
2. Click the meatballs in the top right corner of the post
3. Select “Mute notifications”
4. Choose for how long you want to mute notifications. You can choose between:
  - 8 hours
  - Til tomorrow
  - Til next week
  - Forever

Activity and push notifications for that post are muted for the time period selected starting from when you selected to mute notifications. During that time, activity won’t be created, and push notifications won’t be sent for that post.

Muting notifications on a post does not remove previous activity or push notifications that were received before the post’s notifications were muted.

While notifications on a post are muted, activity for that post will not be recorded in your [blog’s activity](https://www.tumblr.com/blog/invisiblevalet/activity). All activity will still be visible in the notes on the post which you can view by clicking the notes in the post’s footer.

### Subscribe to a Tumblr

You can subscribe to a blog you follow to get notifications whenever it’s updated with a fresh post. You would get a blue dot on the ‘Home’ left menu on web if you have the ‘Following’ tab as default, and a push notification on your app.
