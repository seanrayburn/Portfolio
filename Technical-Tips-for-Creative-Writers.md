## Punctuating Dialogue
Use a comma to introduce dialogue.
- Example: He said, “I have two dogs.” 

Keep the dialogue punctuation inside the quotations.
- Example: “What movie should we watch?” she asked.

Use a comma when there is a “tag” or a responsive action following the dialogue.
- Example: “I can’t go tonight,” he sighed.

If dialogue is interrupted by an action, use a comma inside the first set of quotation marks and before the second opening quotation mark.
- Example: “I need to make dinner,” he said, “but I have to go grocery shopping first.”

As a general rule, a new speaker means there is a new paragraph. Indicate different speakers by using paragraph breaks. The following is an example from The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller.
- Example:「“I’m sorry,” Achilles said.
  “Leave me,” the old king whispered. We obeyed.」

## Punctuating Titles

Use italics to denote titles or names of long-form works, such as books, films, TV shows, podcasts, magazines, and albums. 
- Example: The Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann (Novel).
- Example: Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend (Podcast).

Use quotations to indicate individual short-form works, such as chapters, articles, song titles, or episodes.
- Example: The first song on David Bowie’s album Lodger is “Fantastic Voyage”.
- Example: Season 1, Episode 5 of Dexter is “Love American Style”.

## Parentheses ( ) vs Em Dash —

- Parentheses indicate additional, non-critical text. Em dashes interrupt a sentence by interjecting a thought or additional information. 
- Avoid using parentheses when possible because they are often skipped. Instead, use em dashes to indicate additional, contextualising information that you want the reader to absorb. 

## General Tips
💡 Ask yourself, “Am I showing or telling?” 
- Consider rephrasing, restructuring, or employing grammatical tools to enhance the flow, emphasise emotional impact, or create nuance where desired.

💡 Read your work out loud to ensure it sounds the way you intend it to. 

💡 Know your audience, and write to them. 

💡 Maintain a singular tense!
