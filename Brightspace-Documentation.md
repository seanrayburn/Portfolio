# My Edited Version of “About SCORM”

Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) is a collection of standards that outlines how online learning materials and learning management systems should interact with one another. For additional details, visit [SCORM Explained 101](https://scorm.com/scorm-explained/). 

Organizations who use the legacy Brightspace SCORM solution with the Brightspace Learning Repository can save a SCORM object in the Learning Object Repository (LOR) and share it out to multiple courses. This allows you to reuse SCORM objects in multiple locations while saving space in each course. 

**Note**: LOR doesn’t support publishing SCORM 2004 content from your computer.
To use the new SCORM solution, you must enable the Content Service for your organization. If you don’t enable the Content Service, you can continue to use the legacy SCORM solution.

When you use the new SCORM solution, you can still:
- Link objects to multiple courses using dynamic or static links.
- Save a SCORM object in the LOR to share it with multiple courses.
- Reuse SCORM objects in multiple locations to optimize space.
- Use Import/Export/Copy Components to add a part or a whole course containing SCORM objects to another course in Brightspace.

**Note**: The new and legacy SCORM solutions can be used at the same time. However, we recommend not using both solutions in the same course as it can cause confusion and be difficult to administer both. 

Brightspace is SCORM 1.2 and SCORM 2004 compliant. SCORM can be used with mobile devices if the SCORM object works on mobile devices. Access the non-mobile version of your site to make the best use of the SCORM object.

Because each authoring tool may interpret SCORM standards differently, consider viewing any SCORM-related documentation resources provided by your third-party authoring tool.

SCORM stands for Sharable Content Object Reference Model. It is a collection of standards that outlines how online learning materials and learning management systems should interact with one another.

For additional details, visit [SCORM Explained 101](https://scorm.com/scorm-explained/). If you are using the legacy Brightspace SCORM solution and have Brightspace Learning Repository for your organization, you can save a SCORM object in the LOR and share it out to multiple courses. This allows you to reuse SCORM objects in multiple locations while saving space in each course. Be aware that the LOR does not support publishing SCORM 2004 content directly from your computer.

In order to use the new SCORM solution, you must enable the Content Service for your organization. If you do not enable the Content Service, your organization will continue to use the legacy SCORM solution. If you set up and want to use the new SCORM solution, store SCORM objects directly in Brightspace, and not in Brightspace Learning Repository. You then add SCORM objects directly into the content module you want them to reside in, either by uploading new objects, or selecting from stored objects you had previously uploaded. You can still link objects to multiple courses using dynamic or static linking as you could before, and you can use Import/Export/Copy Components to propagate a part of or a whole course containing SCORM objects to another course in Brightspace.

Brightspace is SCORM 1.2 and SCORM 2004 compliant. SCORM can be used with mobile devices, provided the SCORM object has been developed to work on mobile devices. Access the non-mobile version of your site to make best use of the SCORM object.
