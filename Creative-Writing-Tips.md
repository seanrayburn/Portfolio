## Punctuating Dialogue

Use a comma to introduce dialogue.
- Example: He said<ins>, “</ins> I have two dogs.” 

Keep the dialogue punctuation inside the quotations.
➔ Example: “What movie should we watch<ins>?”</ins> she asked.

Use a comma when there is a “tag” or a responsive action following the dialogue.
➔ Example: “I can’t go tonight<ins>,”</ins> he sighed. 

If dialogue is interrupted by an action, use a comma inside the first set of quotation marks and
before the second opening quotation mark.
Example: “I need to make dinner<ins>,”</ins> he said<ins>, “</ins>but I have to go grocery shopping first.”

As a general rule, a new speaker means there is a new paragraph. Indicate different speakers by using paragraph breaks. The following is an example from _The Song of Achilles_ by Madeline Miller. 
➔ Example:「“I’m sorry,” Achilles said.
“Leave me,” the old king whispered. We obeyed.」

## Punctuating Titles

Use italics to denote titles or names of long-form works, such as books, films, TV shows, podcasts, magazines, and albums.

➔ Example: _The Magic Mountain_ by Thomas Mann (Novel)
	
➔ Example: _Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend_ (Podcast)


Use quotations to indicate individual short-form works, such as chapters, articles, song titles, or
episodes.
➔ Example: The first song on David Bowie’s album _Lodger_ (1979) is “Fantastic Voyage”.
➔ Example: Season 1, Episode 5 of _Dexter_ is titled “Love American Style”.

## Italics

Use italics to show emphasis, or note internal monologue or implied dialogue.

➔ Example: "That was supposed to be _my_ drink." 

Note: Don’t bold your text or use all-caps to emphasise text.


## Parentheses ( ) vs Em Dash —-

Parentheses indicate additional, non-critical text. Em dashes interrupt a sentence by interjecting a
thought or additional information.

Avoid using parentheses when possible because they are often skipped. Instead, use em dashes to
indicate additional, contextualising information that you want the reader to absorb.

Note: Screen readers may read em dashes as "dash dash", so be cognizant of this, as it may cause disruption to the flow and impede readability. 


## Food for Thought
💡 Ask yourself, “Am I showing or telling?”
➔ Consider rephrasing, restructuring, or employing grammatical tools to enhance the flow,
emphasise emotional impact, or create nuance where desired.
💡 Read your work out loud to ensure it sounds the way you intend it to.
💡 Know your audience, and write to them.
💡 Maintain a singular tense!
