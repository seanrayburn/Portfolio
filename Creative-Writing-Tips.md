# Creative Writing – Technical Tips 

## Punctuation in Dialogue

Use a comma to introduce dialogue.

- Example: He said<ins>, “</ins> I have two dogs.” 


Add punctuation of the dialogue in the quotations.

- Example: “What movie should we watch<ins>?”</ins> she asked.


Use a comma when there is a tag or responsive action following the dialogue.

- Example: “I can’t go tonight<ins>,”</ins> he sighed. 


Note: If dialogue relies question mark or exclamation point, do not add an additional comma after your closing quotes.

- Example 1: “Are you going to dinner with us<ins>?”</ins> she asked. 

- Example 2: “I love you<ins>!”</ins> he said. 


If dialogue is separated by a tag or responsive action, use commas to note the end of the first part of the dialogue within the closing quotation, and begin the secondary dialogue clause with a comma before the opening quotation.

- Example: “I need to make dinner<ins>,”</ins> he said<ins>, “</ins>but I have to go grocery shopping first.”


Indicate different speakers by using paragraph breaks. The following is an example from The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller.

- Example:「“I’m sorry,” Achilles said.

	“Leave me,” the old king whispered. We obeyed.」


## Punctuating Titles

Use italics to for titles or names of specific works, such as books, films, TV shows, podcasts, magazines, albums, and other long-form works.

- Example: _The Magic Mountain_ by Thomas Mann (Novel)
	
- Example: _Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend_ (Podcast)


Use quotations to indicate individual chapters, articles, song titles, or episodes.

- Example: The first song on David Bowie’s album _Lodger_ is “Fantastic Voyage”

- Example: Season 1, Episode 5 of _Dexter_ is “Love American Style”


## Italics

Use italics to show emphasis, or note internal monologue or implied dialogue.

- Example: "That was supposed to be _my_ drink." 

Note: Don’t bold your text or use all-caps to emphasize text.


## Parentheses versus Em Dash

- Use an em dash to indicate a longer pause than a comma would indicate.
  - Consider an em dash a ½ note pause, where a comma would be a ¼ note pause.


- Avoid parenthesis where possible, as they indicate non-critical text and readers are likely to pass over it. 
  - Instead, consider using em dashes to set aside non-critical text or a “side-note” that stays within the body of the text. 

Note: Screen readers may read em dashes as "dash dash", so be cognizant of this as it may cause disruption to flow and impede readability. 


## Food for Thought
- Ask yourself, are you _showing_ or _telling_? 
  - If you are telling the reader information that can be shown through sentence structure adjustments, punctuation, or other tools, consider rephrasing to improve the flow, comprehension, and impact of your story.


- Always maintain a consistent tense!
