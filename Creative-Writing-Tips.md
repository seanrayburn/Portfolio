# Creative Writing – Technical Tips 

## Punctuation in Dialogue

Use a comma to introduce dialogue.

- Example: He said<ins>, “</ins> I have two dogs.” 


Add punctuation of the dialogue in the quotations.

- Example: “What movie should we watch<ins>?”</ins> she asked.


Use a comma when there is a tag or responsive action following the dialogue.

- Example: “I can’t go tonight<ins>,”</ins> he sighed. 


<ins>Note</ins>: If dialogue relies on punctuation to add meaning or emphasis, such as a question mark or exclamation point, do not add an additional comma.

- Example 1: “Are you going to dinner with us<ins>?”</ins> she asked. 

- Example 2: “I love you<ins>!”</ins> he said. 


If dialogue is separated by a tag or responsive action, use commas to note the end of the first part of the dialogue within the closing quotation, and begin the secondary dialogue clause with a comma before the opening quotation.

- Example: “I need to make dinner<ins>,”</ins> he said<ins>, “</ins>but I have to go grocery shopping first.”


Indicate different speakers by using paragraph breaks. The following is an example from The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller.

- Example:「“I’m sorry,” Achilles said.

	“Leave me,” the old king whispered. We obeyed.」


## Italics

Use italics to denote titles or names of specific works, such as books, films, TV shows, podcasts, magazines, albums, and other long-form works.

- Example: _The Magic Mountain_ by Thomas Mann (Novel)
	
- Example: _Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend_ (Podcast)


<ins>Note</ins>: use quotations to indicate individual chapters, articles, song titles, or episodes.

- Example: The first song on David Bowie’s album _Lodger_ is “Fantastic Voyage”

- Example: Season 1, Episode 5 of _Dexter_ is “Love American Style”


Use italics to show emphasis or deeper meaning, internal monologue, or implied dialogue.

- Example: That was supposed to be my drink


<ins>Note</ins>: Don’t bold your text or use all-caps to emphasize text.


## Parentheses vs. Em Dash

- Use an em dash to indicate a longer pause than a comma would indicate.
  - Consider an em dash a ½ note pause, where a comma would be a ¼ note pause.


- Avoid parenthesis as possible because they generally indicate non-critical text.
  - Instead, consider using em dashes to set aside non-critical text or a “side-note.”


## Food for Thought
- Ask yourself, are you _showing_ or _telling_? 
  - If you are telling the reader information that can be shown through sentence structure adjustments, italics, em dashes, or other tools, consider rephrasing to improve the cadence, nuance, and emotional impact of your story.


- Maintain a singular tense.
