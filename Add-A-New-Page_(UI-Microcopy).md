# UX/UI Copy 

As an avid user of technology, I come across UX/UI copy everyday. Good UX/UI content should be concise, clear, and useful. Here are a few examples of UX/UI copy I’ve seen and how I would improve them:

## UNIQLO Subscribtion Verification

**My version**

Add “noreply@mail.fastretailing.com” to your contacts to ensure you receive the verification email.

**Original version**

Please make sure you can receive emails from “noreply@mail.fastretailing.com” beforehand.

**Reasoning**

The original version didn’t tell the user <i>how</i> to ensure they receive emails from UNIQLO’s email address.

## eCommerce Checkout Page

**My version**

Enter a valid zip code. 

**Original version**

Enter valid data. 

**Reasoning**

The original version wasn’t actionable and it didn’t indicate which data was invalid. 

## Intake Form

**My version**

What is your gender?

**Original version**

What gender do you identify with?

**Reasoning**

Original contained extra words that did not enhance the meaning. Asking someone their gender is the same as asking someone which gender they identify with, since gender is inherently an identity. There is also a risk in referring to gender only as something “you identify with” because that phrasing can be used as an invalidating microagression against transgender and gender-expansive people.
